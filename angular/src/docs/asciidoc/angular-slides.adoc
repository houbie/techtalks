== Agenda
* Why bother?
* Angular in a hurry
* The toolbox
* What's next

== Why bother?

== UX
* Fat client
* Browser

=== Fat clients
[%step]
* Fine grained interactions
* Speed
** < 30 milliseconds

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Web shop: check "delivery address same as billing address"
* Create new address on the fly
* TAB - type - ENTER
--

=== Browser
* Bookmarks
* Back navigation
* Zero install effort

== (Technical) Complexity
=== Code complexity
[%step]
* Components
** Composability
** Scope isolation (locality)
* ajax Context
** Mirror client state
** Build from request
* Programming language
* Testability

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
--

=== Operational complexity
[%step]
* State(less)
** Memory usage
* Course or fine grained request
** Performance
* Multiple clients
** Web
** Mobile
** Server

=== The JQuery solution
<div class="field inline editable" data-required="true">Ivo<div>
$('.editable').editable()
->show real example of editable

* Abusing style class
* Lots of unrelated event handlers
* Re-apply after ajax

== Single Page Applications
* One page with links to JavaScript and CSS
* Scripts take care of:
** user interactions
** communication with server
** rendering views by manipulating the DOM
** change the URL

== Angular in a hurry

== DDD
* Data Binding
* Dependency Injection
* Directives

=== Data Binding
